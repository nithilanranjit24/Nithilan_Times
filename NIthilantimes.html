<p>⦿Taj Mahal the symbol of love is the epitome of grandeur and splendour, you cannot fathom the beauty of this white marbled monument unless you stand in front of it. As you approach Taj Mahal, it gradually becomes known to you that this is no ordinary monument, but a vision come to life! Moved by its beauty and the deep affection of Shah Jahan for Mumtaz, the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore called it "a teardrop on the face of eternity".</p>
<p>⦿Location - Agra</p>
<p>⦿ Tips:-</p>
<p>⦾South Gate, you will have lesser crowd. The South Gate is the least-used gate, reason why you will not have to wait in a longer queue as compared to the other two gates.</p>
<p>⦾The West Gate, which is the main gate, is used by a majority of local visitors. It sees the longest queue of people throughout the day. If you use this gate, the best time will be during sunrise when you can expect fewer crowds.</p>
<p>⦾The East Gate is mainly used by the foreign visitors, especially because it is closest to a number of hotels. If you get your ticket in advance, this will be the best option to use for an entry to the Taj.</p>
<p>⦾If you plan your visit to this monument on the morning of Eid or during World Heritage Week, you will enjoy free entry. But bear in mind, it will be busier than the usual times. If you are savvy and know the details, you can take advantage of this.
